There are two main files, one corresponding to a fixed value of shadowing (sigma as a scalar) is "main_const_shadowing.m"  which plots the localization error of the sensor for several iterations against its CDF, and the other with a variable value of the shadowing term is "main_variable_shadowing.m" . It plots the RMSE (root mean squared error) of the localization error vector over N iterations of the sdp and ML estimators and plots it against sigma, the shadowing term.
